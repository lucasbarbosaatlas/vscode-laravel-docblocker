# Laravel DocBlocker

Laravel DocBlocking extension.

We now have a set of unit tests and some full coverage on the parsing of signatures as well as continuous integration. 
This should ensure the extension remains stable as development progresses.

## Features

* Completion snippet after `/**` above a class, function, class property
* Completion of DocBlock tags such as `@param`, `@return`, `@throws`
* Inferring of param and return types from signatures
* Configuration of template for each type of docblock completion

## Requirements

This extension has no dependencies.
